# Interactive Rating Component

## 📄 Project Overview

This project is all about creating an Interactive Rating Component from Frontend Mentor—a simple tool where users can select a rating and submit it. It was a great way to practice HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript while focusing on user interactions.

## 💡 Biggest Challenges

One tricky part was managing the state for the rating selection. It took some trial and error to make sure everything worked smoothly. Another challenge was designing the component to look good and work well on all screen sizes—but it was super rewarding to see it come together.
